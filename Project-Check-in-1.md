I had the opportunity to assist and volunteer with a Spanish National Geographic photographer, Mr. Andoni Canela, and his son Unai in November 2019. They had traveled to India in order to capture some photos and images of the Black panther, which can be found in Kabini's woods. It was a terrific experience and I learned a lot more about photography throughout this period.  We were all sitting by the lake one evening when I recalled asking Andoni how he discovers other photographers with whom to work. He claimed that finding individuals in the Nat Geo community quickly and readily, as well as keeping track of those in this field who carry out similar activities or take similar pictures, is difficult and that Instagram isn't the best platform for this. 

Returning to that journey, I decided to develop an app that was especially geared for National Geographic photographers. 
The app was inspired by my idea to create a social media platform that would enable National Geographic photographers to share their photographs, work together, interact, and follow each other's projects more closely. 

My project began with sketches I drew on my iPad, as I normally do to help me think of ideas. 
After that, I designed my screens and produced a high-fidelity mockup in Adobe Xd. 
I wanted to make an app that had great images, was aesthetically beautiful, and looked like something NatGeo would have if they ever had a social media app. I am a photographer myself and enjoy visual designs and look forward to getting better at it. I therefore used the logo's colors to develop icons that would complement that style. 

With the exception of the profile pictures, which I acquired on Pinterest, every image utilized in my project are all clicked by me on my iphone. 

This is also the first time I've coded in Swift and first time learning to code this semester, and I must admit that I really battled to push myself to code because I felt inadequate and doubted my abilities. As I began to code, I also had a great deal of worry and imposter syndrome, and I would frequently close my laptop. But I got back up and said, "I can do this," and I started coding and watching your recordings and other YouTube videos. As I went along, everything just started to work well. 

My first step was to code my homepage. I believe the most difficult aspect of learning to code was figuring out how to stack code inside of each other. Even after viewing lessons and reading about it on Apple's developer website, I found it to be quite puzzling. Therefore, the code stacking on my homepage does not seem correct. I also battled with the alignment of icons because I wanted them to appear in a specific area on the screen, but as I began playing with code and attempting different approaches, my code began to come together. When I saw my first screen come to life, I smiled. Because I was adamant about creating this app and was passionate about it, I did not alter my app's concept. I believe the most difficult component was overcoming my nervousness and self-doubt around coding in a new language. However, I did, and I genuinely enjoyed coding as I began to develop the second view of my project.

Since I am new to using GitHub and had trouble getting my files published to a repository, which would create the repository but not upload all of my files, instead I took screenshots of my code and a mockup of the app as I built it.

The sketches and mockup are shown in the screenshots below.
