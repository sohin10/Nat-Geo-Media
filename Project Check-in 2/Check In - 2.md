The second page I coded for my project was the profile page. But before I began coding it, I took a screenshot of the profile page I designed in my mockup and marked which elements of the page belonged to which stack. I've attached a screenshot of the image in question below. 
I believe doing so much aided me in determining which text and images in my code belonged on which stack. Also, I began by coding from top to bottom, which made arranging elements on the screen much simpler. 

### Profile page
While coding the profile page, I learnt about grid layout, as well as how to modify aspect ratios, widths, and heights, add columns and rows, and make the grid scrollable. 

I learned about lazy grids and how to traverse over an array of strings using ForEach. For my homepage, I used the for each tag to loop over the images in the asset folder without having to create an array. However, it was interesting to see how this tag could be coded differently to achieve the same result. I found that extremely intriguing. 

I also learned about buttons and how to hyperlink text and icons. Currently, I've merely made the buttons clickable to demonstrate how they would seem, but they don't lead anywhere; my next objective is to have the buttons open new views. I also want to make each image interactive and a means to view them and read more about the image. 

### Explore Page
I worked on the Explore page following the profile page. I love how swiftui provides you with pre-coded elements, such as the Text Field tag, that only require customization. During the process of coding this view, I learned how to extract subviews. This made my code appear more organized and facilitated the structuring of my design. I also liked that you could declare a variable in one view and use it generically in another view, which makes it easy to maintain a consistent theme and eliminates the need to repeat code (DRY). I also thought it was amazing that you could construct many structs and use them within each other, as well as change things about and create duplicates, and that each struct is also customisable. 

### Message/Chat Page
Next I worked on the Messages page, learned more about extracting and reusing subviews, and discovered that customizing each subview made it simpler to replicate cells containing distinct information. Which I initially did not know how to do. This is why each image on my homepage has the identical profile name and caption. I created the profile images to appear embedded within the NatGeo logo, the yellow rectangle, in Adobe XD and imported them as assets, as opposed to utilizing a shape with a stroke and clipping it to the image. After learning about the stroke on shapes, I decided to add stroke buttons to the profile page. It was also interesting to see how independent code may exist on the same page. The scrollview for profile image thumbnails is horizontal, whilst the scrollview for chats is vertical. 

My objective moving forward is to construct a reels page that incorporates swiftui's AVkit and a camera view that allows you to snap and submit photos to your profile. 


As I continued to code, I began to appreciate it more and more. As previously stated, I am a visual person who enjoys seeing the results of my actions. With this project, I intended to focus on aesthetics and learn how to make something look stylish and attractive using code. I stayed up all night trying to fix my errors, try out new combinations, and see how I could experiment with code; as a result, you may find some commented-out lines in my code, as I kept experimenting with alternative ways of doing something before settling on the one I felt made my design look the best. 


I captured screenshots of my code and drawings as I made modifications, which I will provide below. 
It was incredibly amazing for me to observe how my designs and comprehension of code improved daily, as well as how quickly these improvements occurred.
